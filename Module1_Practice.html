    <p>Jaflong, located between tea gardens and hills, is the tourist hotspot of Sylhet, a hill station, positioned on the border between Bangladesh and Meghalaya, the north-eastern state of India. Also home to the Khasi tribe, Jaflong is famed for its lush, tropical setting and the areas of natural beauty surrounding it.

    These areas include the Piyain River, which flows between Bangladesh and India and is renowned for its crystal clear water that allows visitors to vividly see the array of underwater stones. In Jaflong, visitors can also take in the cascading waterfalls and rich greenery of the mountains of Meghalaya, and visit the historic Dawki Bridge, a suspension bridge built by the British in 1932 and a road border crossing between Bangladesh and India.</p>
